# Graph Generation

Add python scripts to generate your graphs here. 

In this directory, you have access to the following files:
- graphs.py - These are where the graph functions are located to generate standard graphs in matplotlib or seaborn
- helpers.py - These contain helper functions that graphs.py uses to generate graphs

## Generating Graphs

To generate graphs do the following

1. Create a python file in this directory
OPTIONAL: also create a jupyter notebook file. You can also create graphs here to test stuff out
2. Follow the template, or have a look at the other graph generation python files to understand how to use graphs.py
3. Use the libraries to create the graph

Once you have finished above, do the following to output your graph
4. go into your terminal / command line
5. navigate to this directory.
- `pwd`
- `cd (whatever it takes to get here)`
- `cd SYDE2023_Class_Profile/graph_generation`
6. run the following
- `python <YOUR_PYTHON_FILE_NAME_WITH_GRAPHS>.py`
7. Graphs should be found in the ./graphs/ folder
