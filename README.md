## Team member setup
Make sure you have access to the following
- BigQuery - use this to query values to understand the data better
    - Looker - You can use this within BigQuery to generate graphs
- Google Cloud Storage - use this for the CSV files
- Github - here
- Notion - Project Management tool, used for tracking graphs made

If you don't have access, message Kha

## Methods of Chart Generation

1. BigQuery + Looker
- Query the BigQuery tables, and then open the results in Looker Studio
- (IDK how to work this but hopefully we can figure it out)

2. Jupyter / Google Colab + Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Download the CSVs from Google Cloud Storage
- Follow the template in the template folder
- Either use the premade graph functions, or create your own custom graphs through numpy, panads, matplotlib, and seaborn

3. Classic Excel

If there are any issues with chart generation, message Kha and he will fix up the cleaning for that and change the CSV + BigQuery tables
